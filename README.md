# MDEQ - SHINE

This is the second part of the code for the paper "SHINE: SHaring the INverse Estimate from the forward pass for bi-level optimization and implicit models", submitted at the 2021 NeurIPS conference.
This source code allows to reproduce the experiments on multiscale DEQs, i.e. Figure 4, and Figure E.2. in Appendix.

## General instructions

You need Python 3.7 or above to run this code.
You can then install the requirements with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
